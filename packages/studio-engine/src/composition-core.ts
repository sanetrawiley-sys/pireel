/**
 * Studio composition model — core layer: types + shot/duration geometry + template registry + shared text utils.
 *
 * Structure = continuous video (track 0) + multi-track overlay blocks. **Blocks store data only**: `{ templateId, slots, time, track }`;
 * the actual HTML/animation is rendered dynamically at assemble time by the [template registry] + [theme (CSS vars)]. Benefits:
 *  - Adding a template = one registry entry; switching theme = change vars, blocks untouched.
 *  - plan/agent can enumerate templates + slot schema and declaratively pick a template and fill slots (presets only, keeps it pretty).
 *  - Blocks are data → re-renderable, validatable, serializable (save project/version).
 *  - Agent-authored freeform HTML goes through the 'custom' template (slots = {innerHtml,timelineBody}), keeping flexibility.
 *
 * Layering (external entry is always the './composition' barrel, don't import this file directly):
 *   composition-core (this file, no sibling deps) ← templates (render impl + registration, import side effect)
 *   ← assemble (assemble the full document) / block-factory (block constructors)
 *
 * Convention: data-start/duration = global seconds; a block's GSAP timeline uses local time (0 = block start), assemble registers to
 * window.__timelines[block.id]; template selectors are always #blockId scoped.
