/**
 * The SINGLE exit for studio prompts.
 *
 * Organization: one prompt per .ts file (prompts change often; separate files
 * diff and revert cleanly). Variable injection = function params + native ${}
 * (compile-time safety net); concatenation = template-literal splicing
 * Consumers always import
 * from here, never poke sibling files directly.
 *
 * How to extend:
 *  - Static prompt: create xxx.ts exporting a const → re-export here.
 *  - Prompt with variables: export a function whose params are the variables
 *    (typos blow up at compile time, no template engine needed).
 *  - Large request-time dynamic content (narration script / composition snapshot)
 *    does NOT go in this directory — that's buildXxxPrompt's job; baking it into
 *    a static section would poison the prompt cache prefix.
 *
 * Discipline: body is always English (system-prompt rule); ``` fences in the body
 * must be escaped as \`\`\`; when changing block-system, run the compose.test
 * quality contract first and have the user run the STUDIO_EVAL benchmark.
