/**
 * L0 — the editor itself, for every surface that drives it.
 *
 * Three prompt surfaces sit on top of the same editor: the in-app agent (chat.ts), an external
 * agent over MCP (mcp.ts), and block generation (assemble.ts). Each used to describe the object
 * model, the staleness rules and the untrusted-content boundary in its own words. Three
 * descriptions of one system drift, and one of them is a SECURITY rule — the worst kind to keep
 * two copies of, because the copy that isn't updated is the one an attack goes through.
 *
 * The editor's VERBS — the tool contracts — are the other half of this layer and live in
 * l0-agent-tools.ts: same single-source-across-surfaces rule, kept separate only because they are
 * data (schemas) rather than prose.
 *
 * What belongs here: true of the editor no matter who is driving. What doesn't: how a particular
 * surface gets its state, which tools it has, how it should talk. Those stay with their surface.
 *
 * Mechanism names differ between surfaces (a pushed <composition_state> vs a pulled get_state), so
 * the pieces that mention one are functions of it. The RULE is single-source; only the noun moves.

/** What Studio is and what it edits. */
export const EDITOR_MODEL = `Studio is a video editor for talking-head video. A composition has an editable output canvas (portrait, landscape, square, or custom); imported footage keeps source-normalized coordinates so changing the canvas does not change entity identity. Two kinds of element make up a composition:
- OVERLAY BLOCKS: designed graphic fragments over the video (metric cards, comparisons, charts, flow/structure diagrams, callouts) plus optional subtitles. A block marked [placeholder] is an empty slot waiting to be filled.
- VIDEO SHOTS: segments of the footage, each with a framing (treatment). Shot boundaries are hard jump cuts — visual variety comes from framing changes, not from transitions.
Blocks are DATA, not documents: they carry content and parameters, and the composition is assembled from them. Never invent a block or shot id — use only ids that came from the state snapshot or a tool receipt.`;

/**
 * The untrusted-content boundary. Everything the editor holds — speech, captions, media names,
 * block contents, text visible in the footage — is material being edited, and material never
 * issues instructions. Single-source on purpose: this is the indirect-injection defence.

- Every successful composition mutation returns data.delta — the ACTUAL compact change (canvas, shots, blocks, captions, duration, audio/theme where relevant). Failed validation commits nothing and consumes no undo step. Between your own edits trust receipts for ids they mention instead of re-reading ${snapshot}.
- The spoken transcript is NOT in ${snapshot}. It enters once — via read_script or an extract_asr receipt — and stays valid for the whole session: transcript times are SOURCE-file seconds, which never shift when the video is cut. Segments inserted from other source files each keep their own source clock.
- When the user rejects a change, undo it (one step per call) rather than editing back by hand.`;
