/**
 * Editor document V2 — the neutral timeline substrate underneath Pireel's semantic
 * talking-head workflow.
 *
 * Design rules (modelled after the standard NLE Timeline -> Track[] -> Clip[] shape):
 *  - the primary track is valid when empty; non-primary tracks are created transactionally with content;
 *  - every placed item has an explicit timeline position;
 *  - media identity lives in the asset manifest, never in a special "main video" field;
 *  - primary narration, managed captions and music are semantic roles, not magic track indexes;
 *  - transcript/scene data remains a first-class Pireel layer above the neutral timeline.
 *
 * Persisted V1 conversion is isolated to the one-shot online migration. Runtime callers receive
 * V2 only; Composition is an explicit, read-only render projection.
